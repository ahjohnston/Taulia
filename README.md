Create a password validator

Thanks for applying to work at Taulia! We’re looking forward to seeing if we’re a good fit
for each other.
For this exercise, we’d like you to create a password validator. We’d love to see your
React skills, but if you are more comfortable in a different framework (Angular, Vue, etc)
feel free to use that instead. We’d like you not to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

Here are some requirements for this component:
● It is styled to look like the above mockup
● It has a toggle checkbox for showing and hiding the password text
● On each keystroke, it validates that the string
○ Is between 8 and 72 characters long
○ Contains at least 1 uppercase character
○ Contains at least 1 lowercase character
○ Contains at least 1 numeric character
○ Does not match the user’s email address (e.g. the email is
bob@gmail.com and the password does not contain “bob” or
“bob@gmail.com”) which is dynamically retrieved from this endpoint:
https://run.mocky.io/v3/09e642b5-b52f-43c1-837b-8ebf70c10813
● It adds strike out styling to the validation requirement when it is met
Create your project using whatever method you’re comfortable with such as
CodePen.io, JSFiddle.net or GitHub.
We are excited to see your final code!
